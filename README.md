Thank you for viewing this project!

I have yet to create a working build that doesn't require cocoapods.

So to build and run project:

1) open the terminal and cd into the folder where you saved the project 

2) cd into 20190206-CalebRocha-NYCSchools

3) terminal comand: pod install

4) double click the .xcworkspace file that is created - 20190206-CalebRocha-NYCSchools.xcworkspace

************ A FEW THINGS TO NOTE ************

I have used Objective-C in all my previous iOS projects. This was my first ever venture into Swift programming and I really enjoyed it. That being said, I am positive my Swift programming could use improvement.

I used StoryBoard and auto layout, but if I was working on a larger project I would have used XIBs or programmatically created and adjusted the views. This would allow for better control and manipulation of the views.

I do not think this app will be made public, but if so, below are the attributes required for using the icons. They were all downloaded from www.flaticon.com.

************ PROJECT DESCRIPTION ************


Coding Challenge: NYC Schools

GOAL: Verify candidate can provide a technical solution and follow instructions

REQUIREMENTS:

These requirements are rather high-level and vague. If details are omitted, it is because we will be happy with any of a wide variety of solutions. Don't worry about finding "the" solution. Feel free to be creative with the requirements. Your goal is to impress (but do so with clean code). Create a native app to provide information on NYC High schools.
Display a list of NYC High Schools. 

1) Display a list of NYC High Schools. 

	Get your data here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/DOE-High-School-Directory-2017/s3k6-pzi2

2) Selecting a school should show additional information about the school.

	a) Display all the SAT scores - include Math, Reading and Writing. 
  
		SAT data here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4

	b) It is up to you to decide what additional information to display


When creating a name for your project, please use the following naming convention:
YYYYMMDD-[First&LastName]-NYCSchools (Example: 20180101-DanielleBordner-NYCSchools)
In order to prevent you from running down rabbit holes that are less important to us, try to prioritize the following:

What is Important:
	
	a) Proper function – requirements met.

	b) Well-constructed, easy-to-follow, commented code (especially comment hacks or workarounds made in the interest of expediency (i.e. // given more time I would prefer to wrap this in a blah blah blah pattern blah blah )).

	c) Proper separation of concerns and best-practice coding patterns.

	d) Defensive code that graciously handles unexpected edge cases.


What is Less Important:

	a)Demonstrating technologies or techniques you are not already familiar with.

Bonus Points!

	a) Unit Tests
  
	b) Additional functionality – whatever you see fit.


iOS:

	a) For applications that include CocoaPods with their project code, having the Pods included in the code commits as source is recommended. (Even though it goes against the CocoaPods general rules). 
	
	b) Be sure to use safe area insets.
	
	c) Make sure your app is compatible with iPhone X.
	
	d) Use Swift as the primary language. Combination of Swift and Objective would be good to show case your skills in both languages


As mentioned, you are not expected to function in a vacuum. Use all the online resources you can find, and please do contact us with questions or for interim feedback if you desire.
